# logic
 - way to undo any command
 - brainstorm on "repeat" command

# interface
 - error when reaching the end of the window

# tools
 - files tools: copy, move, delete ...
 - emoji: get emoji based on name

# Development
 - FIXME and TODO policy
     - The person that created the code is responsible for either modifying the code, or adding a commment to explain why there is nothing to modify ?
 - Define minimal python version (python 3.10 ? python 3.8 ?)
     - are we allowed to use match, specific type hinting etc. ?



# New ideas:
 - 2 stacks: one for numbers and one for strings
 - hability to store and swap different stacks (one active stack, but many stacks on memory that you can swap with the active one)
 - way to repeat commands by reading the number on the number stack (like in vim)
 - repeat a command until error (end of stack for example) (with `*` ?)
