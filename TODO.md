# logic
- way to undo any command
- brainstorm on "repeat" command

# interface
- error when reaching the end of the window

# tools
- files tools: copy, move, delete ...
- emoji: get emoji based on name


# New ideas:
- 2 stacks: one for numbers and one for strings
- way to repeat commands by reading the number on the number stack (like in vim)
