# o-tomat

Tomat is your assistant

o-Tomat know his state

How Tomat can be helpful ?

By stacking your commands of course !

## Current look



## Construction
Tomat is based on the idea of a [push-down automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton)

## Thesis

I built this thing to answer this very simple question:

> How can an extensible modular pile-based automata be usefull for human-to-machine communication, and what could be the effects of the instant feedback paradigm on the design of human-to-computer interfaces ?

## Future

We will take this project **to the moon !** ðŸš€
